Roscommon's Conor Hussey: “Last year we’d have put a lot of stock into the League in terms of staying up and that was a big priority for us and to be able to show that you can match it with the top teams and it’s possible maybe that after putting that mental effort as much as anything that when it came to the All-Ireland series that maybe we lacked that few percentage to get over the line against the likes of Kildare and the likes of the Cork game.

“So it could flip on its head this year maybe and we’re hopeful. We’re lucky to have a [Connacht] semi-final but regardless, there’s still three guaranteed All-Ireland games they’re, at the end of the day, what we’re really hoping to perform in.”
